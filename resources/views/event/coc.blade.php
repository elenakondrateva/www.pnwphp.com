@endsection

@section('introduction')
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p><strong>The Pacific Northwest PHP Conference</strong> (PNW PHP) is a volunteer-run community event, and invites anyone with a desire to talk and learn about PHP and related technologies to gather together, share their knowledge, and promote the PHP community in the Seattle, WA, and Puget Sound area.</p>

    <p><strong>PNW PHP aims to be inclusive</strong> to the largest number of contributors as possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of their professional or personal background including education, experience, age, ability, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability, physical appearance, or religion. We invite all those who participate in PNW PHP to help us in creating such an environment.</p>

    <p><strong>This Code of Conduct (CoC) outlines the expectations of all who participate</strong>, as well as how we should respond to unacceptable behavior. We expect participants will abide by this CoC in all community venuesâ€”whether online or in-person as well as in one-on-one communications in, around, or relating to the event.</p>

    <h3>Expectations</h3>
    <strong>We are all expected to:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Behave professionally.</li>
        <li><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Exercise consideration and respect in our speech and actions.</li>
        <li><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Attempt collaboration before conflict.</li>
        <li><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Refrain from any unacceptable behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Unacceptable behaviors include:</strong> intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning speech or actions by any participant. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.</p>

    <p><strong>Harassment includes:</strong> harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

    <p><strong>Our expectation is that we will treat each other, and others our community interacts with, with consideration, empathy, and respect.</strong> Our speech and behavior will be guided by a desire to create and maintain an inclusive community purposed towards sharing knowledge and encouraging enthusiasm for solving problems with PHP.</p>

    <br/>
    <h3>Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
    <p>Unacceptable behavior from any participant, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.</p>

    <p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from events without warning and without refund.</p>

    <br/>
    <h3>Complaints</h3>
    <p>It is every participant's responsibility to notice, and attempt to intervene or notify others, if unacceptable behaviors are occurring at a gathering or event.</p>

    <p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify an organizer as soon as possible. You can contact the organizers at admins@pnwphp.com, send a direct message to <a href="http://twitter.com/pnwphp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@pnwphp</a> on twitter, or speak to an organizer in person or online.</p>

    The current organizers are:
